There are two folders, namely, VCCA and VCCAPrivate, the journal of both the topics is present in the main folder, it can be used as a reference for understanding of the concepts.  
# VCCA

The VCCA folder contains 5 files:

## vcca.py:
The file containing the fit() method, loss() method, and finally transform() method.

## autoencoder.py :
The file containing the Autoencoder class, which inherits from nn.module of pytorch, which indeed is our neural network.

## utils.py :
Contains the code to concat two datasets

## example_vcca_code.py :
Contains a sample code showing implementation of VCCA.

## VCCA_Documentation.html
Documentation of the VCCA sample code.

# VCCA PRIVATE
The VCCAPrivate folder contains 5 files:

## vcca_pvt.py:
The file containing the fit() method, loss() method, and finally transform() method.

## autoencoder_pvt.py :
The file containing the Autoencoder class, which inherits from nn.module of pytorch, which indeed is our neural network.

## utils.py :
Contains the code to concat two datasets

## example_vcca_private_code.py :
Contains a sample code showing implementation of VCCA PRIVATE.

## VCCA_PRIVATE_DOCUMENTATION.html
Documentation of the VCCA PRIVATE sample code
